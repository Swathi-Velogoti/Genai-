Statistical data analaysis

- Hypothesis testing

null hypothesis- there is relationship between training and placement
alternate hypothesis- there is no effect of training on placement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Population and sample

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std, variance, covariance, skewness, normalization and standardization)

2- inferential statiscs
- parametric (here we make assumptions about the population- data should be normally distributed)

---- t-test (comparing the means)
---- z-test (comparing the means)
---- anova test (compare the variance between two groups)
---- f-test (compare the variance between two groups)
---- Ab testing (facebook ad campaign)

- non parametric (there will may or may not have assumption)

---- chi square test (find out the relationship between two categorical variable)
---- ks test (whehter a column is normally distributed of not)

- Scipy (Scientific python)
